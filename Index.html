 <h5 style="color: white">"fuck your reincarnation"</h5>
 <p>Listen to me I am sick of your dumb ass reincarnating as animals over and over again and coming to visit me at my house as a supposed "sign of your presence". I keep killing the things you come back as every time on purpose. I do not want a dog to live here nor a cat nor a beautiful bird nor that which crawls beneath the Earth. We're THROUGH. <span style=" color: #d9fff8">The relationship ended when your life as a human did.</span> I get that you want to keep this "Twin flame" soul mate reincarnation bullshit afloat but 1. I will not be returning to the cycle of death and rebirth due to my dark heart AND 2. Even if I did come back, good luck being born a human around the same time as me once more, Asshole. I'm salting the earth around my yard so that from the ground no plants may grow and from there comes no germs from plants, no bugs from germs, no birds from bugs, no beasts from birds. No you.

<p id="p2">i think i’ve made this post before but they need to show more cock in tv shows like not even for a horny reason because obviously if i want that there’s plenty of cock pics & vids on the internet. but i just think it adds a little something like yay penis!</p>

<p class="odd">I hope yashiro finds out that doumeki told inami that inami sucks at sex. I feel like yashiro would literally cry from laughter lol </p>

<p class="even">yes all my favorite characters are desperate to be loved. no i don’t think that says anything about me.</p>
<hr>
<p class="odd">there is a deep pathological sadness and loneliness you just can’t shake off that comes from having a traumatic childhood and broken family which I still haven’t come to terms with.</p>

<p id="p3"> If I had the death note I wouldn’t even care about killing people the real kicker is that you can bend their will before they die. Like who cares if I could give joe biden a heart attack BUT i could make him go up the the podium and say something like “I need a thick girl and a blunt right now or I’ll die” and then he explodes. That’s where the money is.

<div id="box1"> Folks have got to understand that they probably aren't messed up by some Secret Big Trauma that they just can't remember; but rather by a million tiny microtraumas that they do mostly remember but don't even register as traumatic because nobody actually understood that these things would cause trauma, much less stack on each other over the years.</div>
<div id="box2"> Whether you're carrying one big rock or a big ol' bucket of sand, it's going to weigh on you just as much.</div>
<div id="box3"> After years and years of this, your nervous system gets "stuck" in an activated threat response. It never really lets you rest, and if this started when you were a kid, you may not develop a lot of neural pathways that you should have, because your brain was too focused on keeping you safe to bother with little things like "genuine human connection" and "interpersonal attachment."</div>

<p>“omg I love that show!” yeah me too it makes up 34% of my core personality. unfortunately i can’t discuss it in public without having a meltdown.</p>
<p id="p4">"I could fix him." I could make him worse. Good for you. I could gently take the weapon out of his shaking, blood-soaked hand and hold him until he finally believes that he doesn't have to be defined by all the ways the world has hurt him. Then we could ruin the lives of everyone who has ever treated him like he's a monster who doesn't deserve love.</p>
